# [Automatic analysis of the difference image for unsupervised change detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/843009/)

This paper frames the change detection problem in the form of Bayes' Decision Theory. The authors propose two different learning
algorithms, one supervised and the other unsupervised while using Expectation-Maximization (EM) for parameter estimation. The main points are
mentioned below:
